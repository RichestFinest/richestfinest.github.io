        <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the Riche$t Fine$t Terms of Service! To help govern our relationship with you, you must agree to the Terms of Service.</p><br>

        <h1>Introduction and Miscellaneous</h1>
        <p><strong>Introduction.</strong>  The Riche$t Fine$t Terms of Service which are written in this document (the "Terms") govern all your activites on this website's contents 
            (hyperlink: <a href="https://richestfinest.github.io">https://richestfinest.github.io</a>) (the "Website" or "Site") and your 
            access/usage of the comics (the "Content") and any email notifiers, buttons, or other services that we provide without cost (the 
            "Services")<br>The Terms shall be located at this hyperlink: 
            <a href="https://richestfinest.github.io/terms-of-service.html">https://richestfinest.github.io/terms-of-service.html</a></p>
        <p><strong>Consent.</strong>  If you are below the age of 18, your legal guardian must agree to the Terms on your behalf.</p>
        <p><strong>Language.</strong> Terms are originally written in English. Should a translation of the Terms conflict with the original, the original shall
            override.</p>
        <p><strong>Enforcement.</strong>  If any section of the Terms is not properly enforced, deemed invalid, or otherwise nullified, it does not constitute a nullification of the remainder. 
            The remaining sections of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
        <p><strong>Location.</strong>  The Site and the Services are subject to the laws of Ontario, Canada. Therefore, when the Terms mentions "law" or "applicable law", it is referring to
            the laws of the aforementioned location. Should your local laws conflict with Ontario, Canada's laws, or prohibit the Terms from acting in full force and effect, you
            may not access the Site, Services, or Content.</p>

        <h1>Subscriptions</h1>

            and publishers of Richest Finest, and affiliates, (alternatively, the "Company", "we", "us", or "our")) is an emailing service (the "Subscription Service" or 
            "Subscription") which sends an email when new Content is uploaded. However, the Subscription Service may also send emails
            not related to new Content.</p>
        <p><strong>Where.</strong>  The Subscription can be accessed at this page located on the Site: <a href="/subscribe.html">subscribe.html</a>.</p>
